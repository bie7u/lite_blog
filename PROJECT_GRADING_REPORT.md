## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Technical Implementation (38/40 points)

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Django Setup (10/10):** Properly configured Django 5.2.4 project with correct settings
- ✅ **Database Design (9/10):** Well-structured models with appropriate relationships
  - Category and Article models with proper ForeignKey relationship
  - Use of RichTextUploadingField for content
  - Auto timestamps with created_at/updated_at
- ✅ **Views & URLs (9/10):** Clean function-based views with proper URL routing
  - HTMX integration for partial rendering
  - Proper use of Django shortcuts (get_object_or_404)
  - Pagination implementation
- ✅ **Static Files (5/5):** Well-organized static file structure
- ✅ **HTMX Integration (5/5):** Modern approach to dynamic UI updates

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Minor: Could use class-based views for more complex operations
- Model verbose names could be improved ("Categorys" should be "Categories")

### 2. Code Quality & Best Practices (20/25 points)

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Code Organization (8/10):** Logical file structure following Django conventions

- ✅ **Template Structure (4/5):** Good separation with base template and partials

**Security & Best Practices Issues:**
- ❌ **Security (0/5):** Major security concerns identified:
